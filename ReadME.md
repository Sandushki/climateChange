# Awareness in Climate Change
**A project that is trying to help fight with climate change**
<br/>Sander Mehmet Çelebiler

This project aims to help people create solutions to climate change. With its integrated AI platform and Forum page, people can learn, have fun, and be heard. This way, this website creates an environment that makes people think of solutions and share their ideas.

##  Project Description
This website's goal is to help people develop ways to fight with climate change. The website DOES NOT contain any informative article by default, but gives the environment for people to create informative articles and be heard. This helps information form and people gather in a single subject that the people now try to think and share ways of fighting with climate change. <br/>

The only way this website informs is by user-created posts and an AI model that classifies which factor of climate change is being considered.

##  Functions of the Project
This website is rich in AI tools and user input systems. The website contains Forums which allows users to input large bodies of text easily with the help of Speech Recognition. It also contains an AI model which allows users to input images and help artificial intelligence classify which factor of climate change is being considered, to help users develop a solving method easier, by classifying to different groups solved by different ways.

There are the folowing in the project:
* AI image classification model for factors of Climate Change else than Noise Pollution
* Speech Recognition via Google Cloud support in the Forum's posting page
* Forum database support -- saves and displays all of the uploaded bodies of text

These functions help users find solutions to Climate Change in the best way.

##  How to Set Up YOUR OWN
You can quickly set up your own version of this basic project by doing the following steps.
1. Download code from GitHUB
2. Open code in your local editor
3. Create a Virtual Environment by doing the following:
   1. Open BASH terminal in your editor
   2. Enter the following commands:
      1. pip install pipenv
      2. pip install --upgrade pip
      3. pipenv install flask
      4. pipenv install flask_sqlalchemy
      5. pipenv install os
      6. pipenv install tensorflow==2.14.0
      7. pipenv install 'numpy<2'
      8. pipenv install pillow
      9. pip install pyaudio
      10. pipenv install speechrecognition
    3. If on MAC continue doing the following steps. If on Windows, you can skip to step 4 (step that comes after VII)
    4. Open terminal
    5. Enter the following command:
       * /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    6. Do the instructions given on the terminal
    7. Enter the following command:
        * brew install portaudio
4. Open BASH terminal in your editor (again)
5. Enter the following commands:
   1. python3
   2. from main import app, db
   3. app.app_context().push()
   4. db.create_all()
   
***Phew!*** That was hard (at least for me)! I hope you managed set up the code. Now you are ready, and you can run the main.py file and follow the instructions there to run your own version of your project!

##  Giving Feedback
You can give feedback to the website via this E-Mail: msander03@icloud.com . You can also give feedback the easiest by posting to the forums page! This way, you have the chance to reach possible interests AND explain your thoughts and give feedback, also with the help of speech recognition speech-to-text dictation. Have fun!

## Importance
This project is crucial in fighting with climate change. This project can help fight with climate change and help people share their ideas and give solutions to problems. This way, the world climate change problem can descend and the world can get a cleaner, easier-to-live place. Fighting with climate change is also very helpful in improving the health of people and health products, because most health products rely and develop on nature. If climate change descends, health products can improve, potentially helping all of the living organizms(including you). Also, getting climate change descend can make the world cleaner and healthier to live in, potentially improving the health of living things(including us) and average lifetime. If continued, these potential effects can go on forever. This is because this project is that important has has so many values. Thank you for reading until here and the Climate Change community wishes you a clean day!
